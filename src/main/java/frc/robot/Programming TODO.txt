HIGH PRIORITY:

- Manual Control
-- [X] Startup Arm Safties (Change setpoint to current position on enabling robot to prevent the bot from developing an appetite for fingers.)
-- [ ] Subsystem and Commands for climber
-- [ ] Shooter RPM PID Control
-- [ ] Intake RPM PID Control
-- [X] Intake/Shooter Default command

- Arm Setpoints
-- [*] Setpoint path generation
-- [ ] Add time delay for arm retraction, or support for arm retraction limit switch?

- [ ] Axis Boolean Supplier Class
-- [ ] Multiple Thresholds per Axis?

MODERATE PRIORITY:

- Autonomous

-[ ] Fix Axis Supplier Deadzones

-- [*] Path Planner
-- [ ] Vision Based Autonomous Intake/Shoot Commands
--- [ ] Intake
--- [ ] Speaker Shot
--- [ ] Amp?

- Photon Vision
-- [ ] Update Vision libs
-- [ ] Build Vision Commands

- Semi-Manual Functions
-- [*] Intake
--- [*] Automatically Intake to position and index
---- [*] Detect Ring Position using color sensor proximity
---- [ ] OR add a second color sensor for indexing
-- [*] Speaker
-- [*] Integrate setpoints with automatic cycles (Now Called functionalSetpoints) (e.g. spin up shooter wheels automatically while going to shoot setpoint)

LOW PRIORITY:

- [ ] Update readme (is currently copied from yagsl)
- [ ] Dynamically planned autonomous (sendable choosers? network tables?)

- [ ] Rate based dynamic arm control (could allow for faster movements)?
