HIGH PRIORITY:

- Manual Control
-- [X] Startup Arm Safties (Change setpoint to current position on enabling robot to prevent the bot from developing an appetite for fingers.)
-- [ ] Subsystem and Commands for climber
-- [ ] Shooter RPM PID Control
-- [ ] Intake RPM PID Control

- Arm Setpoints
-- [*] Setpoint path generation
-- [ ] Add time delay for arm retraction, or support for arm retraction limit switch?

MODERATE PRIORITY:

- Autonomous
-- [ ]Path Planner

- Photon Vision
-- [ ] Update Vision libs
-- [ ] Build Vision Commands

- Automatic Cycles / Target Tracking
-- [ ] Intake
--- [ ] Automatically Intake to position and index
---- [ ] Detect Ring Position using color sensor proximity
---- [ ] OR add a second color sensor for indexing
-- [ ] Speaker
-- [ ] Amp
-- [ ] Integrate setpoints with automatic cycles (Now Called functionalSetpoints) (e.g. spin up shooter wheels automatically while going to shoot setpoint)

LOW PRIORITY:

- [ ] Update readme (is currently copied from yagsl)
- [ ] Dynamically planned autonomous (sendable choosers? network tables?)
